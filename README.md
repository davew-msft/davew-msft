## Who Am I?

I'm Dave Wentzel and I work at the Microsoft Technology Center in Philadelphia, PA.  

Many technologists have “know-how”, Dave has “know-what” and "know-why".  He strives to understand a business problem before throwing a bunch of Azure at it. Dave works with executives and business and IT leaders to bring ideas to market at the Microsoft Technology Center (MTC) in Philadelphia.  As a former CTO doing data projects for 25 years, he knows the patterns to deliver successful data projects.   
 
Dave’s concentration is in analytic solutions involving data and data science. 

We have implemented successful projects and we know what works.  MTC TAs are in high-demand by our largest healthcare customers and this is a great opportunity to work with them on your most pressing business problems.  

# Repo Index

In my role with Microsoft I publish a lot of source code for workshops and hackathons.  I can't keep track of everything.  This repo is a listing of all of my public-facing repos on both github and git.davewentzel.com.  


## Public Source Code

|Repo Name|Path|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Simple Data Sharing with Blob Storage - "The Blob Uploader"|https://github.com/davew-msft/blob-data-sharing|Simple file sharing using Azure storage accounts is not easy.  You need to "understand" how to upload/download files. Here I create a simple SPA that can be run WITHOUT a webserver. |
|dotfiles|https://git.davewentzel.com/pub/dotfiles|Developers often share their dotfiles. This repo includes all of my scripts to create a new workstation, whether xfce4, Windows, or Mac.  I also have a bunch of my common code snippets.|
|SQL-to-EventHubs|https://git.davewentzel.com/demos/sql2eh|Sends all SQL Server data changes to Event Hubs in near real-time.|
|DockDoop|https://git.davewentzel.com/demos/dockdoop|Running hadoop in Docker containers|
|How to Create a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN to Azure, QUICKLY|https://github.com/davew-msft/azure-P2S-vpn-automation|Azure VPN documentation is not for the feint of heart.  This script will make it far more automated, fast, and less confusing|
|Logical Data Warehousing with SQL Server Big Data Clusters|https://git.davewentzel.com/pub/AKS-BDC-Setup|This quickly sets up a resource group in Azure with SQL BDC running on AKS and allows "data mesh" scenarios to S3, on-prem/AWS SQL Server, Oracle, etc. |

## Data Literacy Series

|Repo Name|Path|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Prescriptive Analytics|https://github.com/davew-msft/PrescriptiveAnalytics|In this session we'll look at a few interesting use cases to understand how Prescriptive Analytics can help you compellingly demonstrate how an organization can be more data literate and insights-driven.|
|Customer Behavioral Analytics|https://github.com/davew-msft/CustomerAnalytics|Customer analytics is a process where we use data from customer behaviors to help make key business decisions. We use the outputs to determine how to do better direct marketing, store and warehouse site selection, and customer relationship management. We want to predict customer behavior and determine how we can shape it.|
|Thinking Like a Data Scientist|https://github.com/davew-msft/data-science-thinking|Thinking analytically about data|
|Building an Analytics Center of Excellence|https://github.com/davew-msft/data-science-thinking/blob/master/CoE.pdf|What to think about when you are building your analytics teams. |
|Design Thinking as an Approach to "Shift Left" Your Analytics Initiatives|https://github.com/davew-msft/data-science-thinking/blob/master/DT.pdf|Design Thinking is a novel approach to remove risk from data projects and to improve "time-to-insights".  |
|How to NOT make analytical cognitive mistakes||One reason analytics projects are risky is because data is difficult. What is the data trying to tell us?  Are we interpreting it correctly?  How can we avoid making cognitive mistakes.|
